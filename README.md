Execution Utilities 
==================

A small library to build commands in java using annotations on classes. 

This library allows a rapid development of commands in java, without bothering of reading arguments from main methods. 
The library contains also a console that can be used to dinamically load big objects and use them as though they are loaded into a web service.
